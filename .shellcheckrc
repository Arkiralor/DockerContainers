# ShellCheck Configuration
# For bash scripts in scripts/ and test/ directories

# Disable specific checks that are not relevant for this project
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (many variables are used in sourced scripts)
# SC1091: Not following sourced files (we don't need to analyze sourced files)
# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes (allow for interactive scripts)
# SC2181: Check exit code directly (allow $? usage for clarity)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (allow combined for brevity)
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing (allow some intentional cases)
# SC2164: Use 'cd ... || exit' (allow simple cd in controlled environments)
# SC2103: Use subshell to avoid cd back (allow simple cd patterns)
# SC2012: Use find instead of ls (allow ls for simple cases)
# SC2010: Don't use ls | grep (allow for legacy compatibility)
# SC2035: Use ./*glob* so names with dashes won't become options
