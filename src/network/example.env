# Optional Shared Network Configuration
#
# This file documents the network settings defined in docker-compose.yml.
# No actual .env file is required as all values are hardcoded in the compose file.
#
# Network Configuration:
# - Name: container-net
# - Subnet: 172.28.0.0/16
# - Gateway: 172.28.0.1
# - Driver: bridge
# - MTU: 1500
#
# These values are fixed for simplicity and do not need customization for
# local development. If you need to modify them, edit docker-compose.yml directly.
